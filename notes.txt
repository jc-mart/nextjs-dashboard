Using Node.js to learn React. Had to find the nodejs package using `pacman -Qs'.

Components: Things to put stuff in
Props: Things that you put data (read-only)
State: Things that are interactive with the user

Static components, things that aren't susceptible to change by user interaction should be rendered on the server; things that will be manipulated by user action should be rendered on the client. This is to aid in performance.

Okay, learned the foundations of react. Using Next.js to practice making a detailed webpage so that I can have the confidence to start developing a church website.

Okay so I can scroll in tmux by pressing `Ctrl+B` followed by `[`. This'll let me scroll up/down

Some commands to test/run project:

1. pnpm run dev / pnpm dev -- dev server
2. pnpm run build -- builds app for production
3. pnpm start -- runs the built app in production mode
4. pnpm i -- install project's packages

Next.js Links allow for prefetching of pages that are in Link tags. Also separates code so it's quicker loading smaller pieces and potentially dodging a page that could throw an error. If all code was downloaded with the error, site wouldn't load.

postgres.js package protects against SQL injection attacks.
Querying the database directly can offload memory usage on client. e.g., when getting the latest invoices, sort them in the SQL request to avoid sorting on device, consuming memory and time.

For data fetches, it's best to wrap them in Suspense components. Best to do it at the granular level, where it's needed. If multiple of the same thing need a data fetch, like multiple cards, you can do a wrapper so that it doesn't create a pop effect but a staggered effect. Prevents UI blocking.
